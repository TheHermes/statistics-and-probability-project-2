## Project 2 - Chi-tv√•-signifikansanalys i Android

This project, "Chi-Square Independence Test," was an individually made project. It involves creating an Android app to collect and analyze survey data using chi-square testing. The app tracks responses via buttons, calculates the chi-square value and p-value, and presents results with explanatory text. Extended functionality includes customizable survey settings, persistent data storage using SharedPreferences, and a dedicated SettingsActivity.
